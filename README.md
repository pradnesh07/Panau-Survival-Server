## Contributing Guidelines
Want to help development? Awesome! Here are a couple guidelines for helping out.

1. Fork the repository.
2. Make your changes in your newly forked repo.
3. Submit a pull request.

I'll review your changes and let you know if there are any problems. If it's all good, I'll merge it with the main repo!

If you'd like to be more involved with development, send me (Lord Farquaad) a DM on [Discord](https://discord.gg/DWGfX3b) telling me a bit about your experience and I'll add you to the developer channel.
